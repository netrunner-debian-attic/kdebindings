Description: UIC compiler and SIP files for PyKDE4
 This package contains pykdeuic4, a wrapper around PyQt's own UIC (user
 interface compiler). It is needed to generate code from Qt Designer's
 UI files. You want to install this package if you are writing a PyKDE
 application which has .uic files, or running one of these applications
 from source.
 .
 It also contains the .sip files for PyKDE4, needed to build packages
 with classes based on PyKDE.
