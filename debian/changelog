kdebindings (4:4.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Resync patches:
    - 01_python_modules_dont_l~k_against_libpython.diff - adapt to upstream
      changes;
    - 03_csharp_dont_use_qyotoshared_directly.diff - fix offsets;
    - 97_fix_target_link_libraries.diff - remove, merged upstream;
    - 99_enable_okular_plasma.diff - remove, not needed.
  * Build Plasma bindings.
  * Bump KDE build depends to 4.2.0.
  * Remove explicit cmake from build depends.
  * Bump SIP build dependencies to >= 4.7.8.
  * Bump python-qt4 dependencies to 4.4.4.
  * Pass -DCMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS=ON to cmake.
  * Make python-kde4 depend on python-qt4 (>= 4.4.4) and python-sip4 (>= 4.7.8)
    (the versions it was built against).
  * Add patches:
    - 06_build_smokephonon.diff - much smoke stuff needs phononsmoke, but that
      one was disabled because it didn't build. Reenable it and hack around its
      brokenness which probably results into useless smokephonon, but working
      builds of other smoke stuff.
    - 07_fix_kpythonpluginfactory_build.diff - include Python.h first as Qt
      includes steal "slots" keyword.
    - 08_csharp_plasma_examples.diff - do not build a few csharp plasma
      examples. They fail.
  * Install a few more files to python-kde4 like python plugin factory.
  * Add libplasma2.0-cil package for plasma-dll.dll based on libnepomuk2.2-cil.
  * Add new plasma-scriptengine-kimono package for Kimono plasma script engine.
  * Install /usr/lib/kde4/kimonopluginfactory.so to libkimono4.1-cil.
  * khtml.dll, nepomuk.dll got renamed to khtml-dll.dll and nepomuk-dll.dll.
    respectively.
  * Update install files.
  * Bump soprano build depend to 2.1.67-2~.
  * Limit Mono dh helpers to Mono packages only.
  * Require debhelper << 7.1 until mono dh helpers are ported.
  * Add 10_fix_kimono_dllimports.diff patch to fix misnamed libkimono
    DllImports.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Do not build python 2.4 bindings anymore: pyversions file indicates python
    2.5 or higher.
  * Switch to debhelper v7 for more flexible install file handling:
    - get rid of manual mono specific installs in debian/rules. Use install
      files instead;
    - no longer pass --sourcedir=debian/tmp to dh_install.
  * Implement autodiscovery of mono L_PATHS and generally try to hardcode as
    less mono paths as possible.
  * Get rid of cdbs include and build dependency:
    - steal list-missing implementation from CDBS.
  * Use simplier approach for debian/rules binary-* target handling.
  * Run dh_installdirs in install-pre target to make mono helpers more silent.

   +++ Changes by David Palacio:

  * Build Ruby Nepomuk bindings (09_build_ruby_nepomuk.diff).

  +++ Changes by Scott Kitterman:

  * Change mono build-dep to mono-devel (>= 2.0.1) for mono 2.0 transition

  +++ Changes by Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez:

  * Switch from python-central to python-support:
    - Replace build depend on python-central for python-support.

    - Replace call to pycentral for pysupport in debian/rules.
  * Bump phonon build depend version to >= 4:4.3.0

  +++ Changes by Sune Vuorela:

  * Small copyright file updates.
  * Create postinst to work around pycentral issues.

kdebindings (4:4.1.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Vincent Fourmond ]
  * Moving libqt4-ruby{,1.8} to section interpreters where they
    currently are (to avoid override disparities)
  * Dropping a libsmokeqt4 dependency that prevent some packages from 
    being installed. (closes: #505274)
  * libqt4-ruby, libkde4-ruby, libplasma-ruby, libokular-ruby are arch:all
  * Copying test files from old libqt4-ruby package
  * 05_rbqtapi_ruby1.8.diff: rbqtapi must use ruby 1.8 rather than ruby
  * Various minor Description improvements
  * Fixing download links (debian/copyright, debian/watch, thanks 
    ana@debian.org)
  * Tighten up dependencies on libsmokeqt4-2 and derivatives, as soname
    of smoke is not really a soname, so we can't expect dpkg-shlibs
    to prevent incorrect linking (thanks Sune !)

  [ Sune Vuorela ]
  * Merge in changes from ubuntu, mostly typofixes in important files. Shame
    on me. Thanks Riddell.
  * Better handling of packages just built on some archs. hopefully fixes the
    build failure on non-mono archs.
