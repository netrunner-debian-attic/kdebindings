kdebindings (4:4.1.3-2) UNRELEASED experimental; urgency=low

  [ Vincent Fourmond ]
  * Moving libqt4-ruby{,1.8} to section interpreters where they
    currently are (to avoid override disparities)
  * Dropping a whole bunch of useless manual libsmokeqt4 dependencies
    that prevent the packages from being installed. (closes: #505274)
  * libqt4-ruby, libkde4-ruby, libplasma-ruby, libokular-ruby are arch:all
  * Copying test files from old libqt4-ruby package
  * 05_rbqtapi_ruby1.8.diff: rbqtapi must use ruby 1.8 rather than ruby
  * Various minor Description improvements
