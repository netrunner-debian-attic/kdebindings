    - r1150375 for SIP > 4.10.
    - r1170602, r1209688, and r1211266 for PyQt4 4.8.x.
    - r1184022 to fix a smokegen segfault when parsing QtOpenGL headers.

kdebindings (4:4.4.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * python-kde4-dev needs to depend on python-kde4, otherwise pykdeuic4.py
    does not work. (Closes: #592286)
  * Few touches to the packages descriptions.
    - ... including the libsmokekutils3 one. (Closes: #592280)

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Move python2.5 dependencies to python-kde4 Suggests (Closes: #595532).
    Even if python-kde4 still provides python2.5 bindings, Python 2.5 is no
    longer a default and hence it is not a pre-requisite for the package to be
    useful on standard Debian install.
  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=X properly.

  * Make python-kde4 depend on python-qt4 (>= 4.4.4) and python-sip4 (>= 4.7.8)
    (the versions it was built against).
  * Add patches:
    - 06_build_smokephonon.diff - much smoke stuff needs phononsmoke, but that
      one was disabled because it didn't build. Reenable it and hack around its
      brokenness which probably results into useless smokephonon, but working
      builds of other smoke stuff.
    - 07_fix_kpythonpluginfactory_build.diff - include Python.h first as Qt
      includes steal "slots" keyword.
    - 08_csharp_plasma_examples.diff - do not build a few csharp plasma
      examples. They fail.
  * Install a few more files to python-kde4 like python plugin factory.

  * Require debhelper << 7.1 until mono dh helpers are ported.
  * Add 10_fix_kimono_dllimports.diff patch to fix misnamed libkimono
    DllImports.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Do not build python 2.4 bindings anymore: pyversions file indicates python
    2.5 or higher.
  * Switch to debhelper v7 for more flexible install file handling:
    - get rid of manual mono specific installs in debian/rules. Use install
      files instead;
    - no longer pass --sourcedir=debian/tmp to dh_install.
  * Implement autodiscovery of mono L_PATHS and generally try to hardcode as
    less mono paths as possible.
  * Get rid of cdbs include and build dependency:
    - steal list-missing implementation from CDBS.
  * Use simplier approach for debian/rules binary-* target handling.
  * Run dh_installdirs in install-pre target to make mono helpers more silent.
