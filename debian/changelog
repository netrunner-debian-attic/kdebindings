kdebindings (4:4.1.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Vincent Fourmond ]
  * Moving libqt4-ruby{,1.8} to section interpreters where they
    currently are (to avoid override disparities)
  * Dropping a libsmokeqt4 dependency that prevent some packages from 
    being installed. (closes: #505274)
  * libqt4-ruby, libkde4-ruby, libplasma-ruby, libokular-ruby are arch:all
  * Copying test files from old libqt4-ruby package
  * 05_rbqtapi_ruby1.8.diff: rbqtapi must use ruby 1.8 rather than ruby
  * Various minor Description improvements
  * Fixing download links (debian/copyright, debian/watch, thanks 
    ana@debian.org)
  * Tighten up dependencies on libsmokeqt4-2 and derivatives, as soname
    of smoke is not really a soname, so we can't expect dpkg-shlibs
    to prevent incorrect linking (thanks Sune !)

  [ Sune Vuorela ]
  * Merge in changes from ubuntu, mostly typofixes in important files. Shame
    on me. Thanks Riddell.
  * Better handling of packages just built on some archs. hopefully fixes the
    build failure on non-mono archs.
