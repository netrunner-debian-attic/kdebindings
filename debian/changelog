kdebindings (4:4.1.85+svn896238-0r2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot.

  * TODO: there are files missing. Check.
  * Build depend on monodoc (TODO: useless?).

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Resync patches:
    - 01_python_modules_dont_l~k_against_libpython.diff - adapt to upstream
      changes;
    - 03_csharp_dont_use_qyotoshared_directly.diff - fix offsets;
    - 97_fix_target_link_libraries.diff - remove, merged upstream;
    - 99_enable_okular_plasma.diff - disable for now.
  * Build depend on libplasma-dev to build plasma bindings.
  * Bump KDE build depends to 4.1.85.
  * Remove explicit cmake from build depends.
  * Build depend on monodoc to build kio_monodoc.
  * Bump SIP build dependencies to >= 4.7.8.
  * Bump python-qt4 dependencies to 4.4.4.
  * Pass -DCMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS=ON to cmake.
  * Make python-kde4 depend on python-qt4 (>= 4.4.4) and python-sip4 (>= 4.7.8)
    (the versions it was built against).
  * Add patches:
    - 07_fix_kpythonpluginfactory_build.diff - include Python.h first as Qt
      includes steals "slots" keyword.
  * Install a more few files to python-kde4 like python plugin factory.
  * Add libplasma2.0-cil package for plasma-dll.dll based on libnepomuk2.2-cil.
  * Add new plasma-scriptengine-kimono package for Kimono plasma script engine.
  * Install /usr/lib/kde4/kimonopluginfactory.so to libkimono4.1-cil.
  * khtml.dll, nepomuk.dll got renamed to khtml-dll.dll and nepomuk-dll.dll.
    respectively.
  * Update install files.

  !! DISCLAIMER !! Changes below are sort of "not really sure what I was doing".

  * Add patches:
    - 06_build_smokephonon.diff - much smoke stuff needs phononsmoke, but that
      one was disabled because it didn't build. Reenable it and hack around its
      brokenness which probably results into useless smokephonon, but working
      builds of other smoke stuff.
    - 08_csharp_plasma_examples.diff - do not build a few csharp plasma
      examples. They fail.
  * A few files disappeared.

   +++ Changes by David Palacio:

  * Build Ruby Nepomuk bindings (09_build_ruby_nepomuk.diff).

kdebindings (4:4.1.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Vincent Fourmond ]
  * Moving libqt4-ruby{,1.8} to section interpreters where they
    currently are (to avoid override disparities)
  * Dropping a libsmokeqt4 dependency that prevent some packages from 
    being installed. (closes: #505274)
  * libqt4-ruby, libkde4-ruby, libplasma-ruby, libokular-ruby are arch:all
  * Copying test files from old libqt4-ruby package
  * 05_rbqtapi_ruby1.8.diff: rbqtapi must use ruby 1.8 rather than ruby
  * Various minor Description improvements
  * Fixing download links (debian/copyright, debian/watch, thanks 
    ana@debian.org)
  * Tighten up dependencies on libsmokeqt4-2 and derivatives, as soname
    of smoke is not really a soname, so we can't expect dpkg-shlibs
    to prevent incorrect linking (thanks Sune !)

  [ Sune Vuorela ]
  * Merge in changes from ubuntu, mostly typofixes in important files. Shame
    on me. Thanks Riddell.
  * Better handling of packages just built on some archs. hopefully fixes the
    build failure on non-mono archs.
